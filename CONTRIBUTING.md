### Issue and Pull Request Labels

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in [open issues in `YCP_EVOS` which haven't been commented on](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+repo%3Asmit-happens%2FYCP_EVOS+comments%3A0&type=).
